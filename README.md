### Notes:
- The `main` branch contains the complete set of labs, including Labs 1–5 and Lab X.
- **Labs 1 and 2**: These labs include a tarball containing all the files created during the lab sessions.
- **Labs 3–5**: In addition to the tarball, these labs also include cleaned source code, with unnecessary binaries removed.
- **Lab X**: This lab does not include any binaries or a tarball, as creating one was not required for this lab.
